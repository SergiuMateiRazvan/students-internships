## Dev Setup

Before installing any Python packages it would be better to create a virtual environment for the app. Best to use pyenv.
See here: https://akrabat.com/creating-virtual-environments-with-pyenv/

Python version used: `3.8.5`

Run the following command to install necessary packages:

`make setup`

When installing new Python packages make sure to freeze it:

`make freeze-requirements`
(Be sure that you are in the virtual env for the project and not add unnecessary packages)


## Run App

`make run`
 
 If you want to change the port or host you can specify them like this:
 
 `make run HOST="127.0.0.5" port=8081`

### Run interface

`make run-interface`

## Linting
Linting the whole project:

`make lint`

Linting the backend:

`make lint-backend`

Linting the frontend:

`make lint-frontend`
